This is an application in the early stages that I am hoping will be able to do the following:

currently, my shop uses two spreadsheets to handle all data.
The first holds data for clients who currently have a system at the shop. phone number, job desc, cost, status, etc.
The second holds a record of all sales and repairs. once a client picks up their system, we delete them from the first sheet and add them to the second.

This application will be used to input data into a MYSQL database for clients as soon as we begin working with them and their system is here.
The status can be updated as we work on their system and this information will show on the webpage.
When the status of a repair is marked as done, it is my hope that this data can be automatically added to the database of past clients.
Functionality will be added at some point to keep track of ALL sales as well as warranties, but the first priority is just to handle general ticketing and data processing.
